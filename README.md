This is basic client side filtering.
As it is not mentioned I did basic approach, but while learning more in nextjs i will do. this was my first project in nextjs :)

Usually in every filter value change we have to call server to  fetch products again.
In case it is required for this interview i can implement more ofc. 

There is no such apis to get products by brand or by query params with price etc, that is why they are done in client side.
